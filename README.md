Inspiration: Restaurants struggle to balance inventory, too much stock leads to waste, while too little leads to missed sales and unhappy customers. While working with data from Mai Shan Yun, we realized that even the smallest inefficiencies in inventory management could have a big financial impact. Our challenge for TAMU Datathon 2025 was to build a tool that would turn raw restaurant data into visual models and actionable insights, helping chefs and managers make smarter, faster decisions.
What it does: Kitchen Inventory Tracker is an interactive dashboard that combines shipment logs, ingredient usage, and menu sales trends to provide a real-time view of inventory. Our dashboard has four overarching tabs, each one with graphs and tables representing real time data provided by the company.
Overview: 
-Displays overall trends, including sales by menu type, individual items sold, total sales, month, and category.
-Shows the number of items sold per month.
-Highlights estimated top menu items based on historical sales data.
Ingredient Usage:
-Ranks top ingredients by usage, helping managers track high-demand items.
-Allows checking usage of specific ingredients to monitor inventory more closely.
Forecast:
-Predicts items sold and revenue, combining historical data with future projections.
-Provides ingredient forecasts, including the top 5 ingredients by predicted total usage.
Shipping:
-Provides shipment forecasting to plan inbound inventory efficiently.
-Includes a slider for custom forecast periods, showing predicted inbound quantities for selected months.
